    
Begin the "for loop" by giving the range of input numbers being used for the program

    for num in range(1, 11):

To check if the numbers are even using the divide operator to check if the remainder is zero, numbers are stored in the "num" variable

     if num % 2 == 0:

Using the continue command to skip the even numbers to only output odd numbers 

    continue

Output all the odd numbers after the loop is run

    print(num)
